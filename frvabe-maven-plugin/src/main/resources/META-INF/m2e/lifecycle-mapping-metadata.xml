<!-- 
    The project build lifecycle inside the eclipse IDE is independent from the 
    Maven build lifecycle. Therefore eclipse needs to know how to handle 
    Maven plugin executions during the build of a project by eclipse.
    There are several ways how Maven Plugins can be made compatible with
    the eclipse IDE. Am easy way is to place this metadata file into the
    plugins META_INF/m2e folder. A detailed explanation can be found here:
    http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/documentation/m2e-making-maven-plugins-compat.html
